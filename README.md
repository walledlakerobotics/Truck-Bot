# Truck-Bot

This repository contains the code used to run our Truck Bot. We run this robot in the Memorial Day parade, along with other events. The code was made in Robot C, which is what the old Vex EDR brains use.

This code consists only of powering the drivetrain, and therefore can be used as a template for other Vex EDR projects. The code has an arcade drive controller scheme in which the Y axis on the left joystick controls forwards/backwards movement while the X axis on the right joystick controls rotational movement. The code also has wheel normalization and slew rates to limit acceleration.
